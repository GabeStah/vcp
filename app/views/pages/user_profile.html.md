## User Profile

Upon signing in with `Battle.net` for the first time, all your `Character` data will be slowly processed in the 
background and added to the system.

If you wish to view the *full* list of `Characters` for your account you may do so by clicking the `Profile` button in the navbar to view
 your account `Profile`.

You can manipulate this table (and many others like it throughout the site) with the sorters at the top of the columns, page navigation, 
and even filter the results with the search box in the top right.  For example, here we are only viewing `Characters` in the _Vox 
Immortalis_ `Guild`:

### Roles

You may also view any assigned `Roles` for a particular `User` by looking at the bottom of his or her `Profile` page.
