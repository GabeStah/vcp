## Characters

The [characters](/characters) page contains a list of all `Active` characters in the system.  An `Active` character (sometimes referred to
 as `Verified`
 as well) is any character that has been successfully confirmed to exist via the `Battle.net API`.  While many inactive characters will 
 be added to the system and visible through the `User Profile` character list, only those that are genuinely confirmed (and thus actively
  played) will be shown in the main [characters](/characters) page.

Typically, a character is `Active` (or `Verified`) if that character has a valid profile on the `Battle.net Armory`.

### Character Profile

### Forcing `Verification`

If you own a character that is `Unverified` that you wish to force a verification performed, you may do so through either the `Character Profile` page, 
or within your character list on your own `User Profile` page.

Simply click on the `Refresh` image corresponding to the character you wish to refresh, and this will queue up a background process to check 
the `Battle.net API` for new character information and update the record of this character accordingly.
